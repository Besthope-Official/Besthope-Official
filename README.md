## WHO am I?

Freshman of SWUFE, majoring in CS ðŸ˜ˆ

## WHAT am I trying to do?

TRYING to become a better version of myself through DIY-CS. (_self-learning CS!_)

Maybe a CS Master is great. Or trying to obtain a double degree in CS and Finance. (_that's hard but I'll try!_)

Sad fact but true, my university is finance oriented( CS in SWUFE is poorðŸ˜­ ), which has led me to re-schedule my study plan for CS courses BEYOND the limited barrier in my whole undergraduate years.

If you are interested in my experience or have similar promblems trying to learn CS on your self, please feel free to contact me! (_we may have a really nice chat!_)

## WHAT am I learning?

[Here](https://csdiy.wiki/) is what I am now following. ðŸ˜‹

It is a free, open and brilliant tutorial for CS self-learning, covering almost all the aspects in computer science.
I strongly recommend it if you have the same willingness to learn CS by yourself. (_And it is perfectly oriented to Chinese students!_)

## My Current status
now I am learning Calculus!
